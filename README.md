As a passionate software developer with a history of diverse, exploratory projects, I have gained a wealth of experience in various aspects of development. In the past, my work was scattered and unorganized, often resulting in lost opportunities and uncompleted projects. Recognizing the need for better organization and strategic focus, I am now dedicated to transforming my approach to development.

Starting June 7, 2024, I am re-organizing my projects and focusing on creating a robust and scalable online shop template. My goal is to build a comprehensive, user-friendly solution that integrates modern design principles with powerful backend functionality. Through meticulous planning, structured development, and continuous improvement, I aim to deliver a template that not only meets the needs of online retailers but also showcases my growth as a developer.

You can follow my work and projects on GitHub at brickwareharry. Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate!

- âš¡ Fun fact: I could code when I was about ten years old. However, I did not have my own computer, so I became a civil engineer in Hong Kong. Immigrating to New Zealand, I got an opportunity to pursue my childhood passion on computer coding, so here I am.
