### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**brickwareharry/brickwareharry** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on on C#, .NET and JavaScript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Microservices.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a hobby project on a team of three.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building an open source Microservices project as a proof of concept for imporving software maintainability. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my project progress
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry-lo-27034265/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he / his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I could code when I was about ten years old. However, I did not have my own computer, so I became a civil engineer in Hong Kong. Immigrating to New Zealand, I got an opportunity to pursue my childhood passion on computer coding, so here I am.
