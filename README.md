### Hi there 👋, I am Harry.

<!--
**brickwareharry/brickwareharry** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🌄 I am building a homelab, see [readme](https://github.com/brickwareharry/homelab/blob/main/README.md).
- 😊 I imagine coding like playing a set of special LEGO bricks. Haha!!
- 🏤 I'm collecting coding challenges in a [playground](https://github.com/brickwareharry/playground).
- 🔭 I’m currently working on C#, .NET and JavaScript, see <a href="https://brickwareharry.github.io/harrycv/" target="_blank">my CV</a> or [my profile](https://www.seek.com.au/profile/harry-lo-nrp25DTPmD).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Microservices in this repository, see below for more information.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a private hobby project on a team of three. This public repository will be integrated into the private project.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with building an open source Microservices project as a proof of concept for imporving software maintainability. 
- 💬 Ask me about my project progress, or see [my diary](https://github.com/brickwareharry/diary).
- 🧠 What I have learned here, see [my notes](https://brickwareharry.github.io/notes/).
- 📫 How to reach me: [My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry-lo-27034265/)
- 😄 Pronouns: he / his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I could code when I was about ten years old. However, I did not have my own computer, so I became a civil engineer in Hong Kong. Immigrating to New Zealand, I got an opportunity to pursue my childhood passion on computer coding, so here I am.

### Project Motivation
I have an aspiration for software development that is like building LEGO bricks and assembling various bricks together to be specific objects in order to achieve high maintainability and flexibility. This is also the reason why this repository is named to be brickware with my name as a suffix. Going with this aspiration, I am on a team of three friends going to upgrade and migrate our hobby project to a modern microservices with comprehensive tests and documentation. This project is a proof of concept for building microservices to improving software maintainability and flexibility, since maintenance cost is crucial.
